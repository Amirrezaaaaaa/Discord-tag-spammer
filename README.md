There may be problems with the libraries in this project, so if you get an error when switching to the Discord tab, just switch to your Discord manually.
Required libraries : **pygetwindow , tkinter , time , keyboard , pyautogui** => `pip install pygetwindow , tkinter , time , keyboard , pyautogui`.
You can also install the necessary libraries by opening the `library_installer.py` file.
